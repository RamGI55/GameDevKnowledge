### Operation System is... 

#### The referee 
who manages the protection, isolation, and sharing the resources 

#### The Illusionist 
Offer the OS to clean, easy-to-use abstractions to deal the physical resources. 
- Infinite memory, dedicated machine 
- Higher level of objects: files, users, messages 
- Masking limitations, virtualisation. 

#### The Glue 
Gives the common services 
- Storage, window system and networking 
- Sharing and authorisation 
- UX and UI 

OS gives the protection. 
- Operating system throws the segment error if a process tried to modify other process. the invalid memory access or untrusted modify storage system unless they're allowed. (Referee) 

OS must manage the diverse hardware complexity.
- Complexity leaks into OS if not properly designed; Third-party device drivers 
- Holes in security model or bugs in OS leads instability and privacy breaches.
